**Key Principles for Mapping to RATS**

Core principles guiding our RATs mapping:

* **Granularity:** Instead of broad role assignments (e.g., "Verifier Role â†’ Verifier"), we'll pinpoint specific components and their functions within the RATS framework.
* **Data Flow:** We'll analyze how evidence, endorsements, and attestation results are generated, processed, and conveyed, aligning these flows with RATS conveyance models.
* **Standardization Focus:** We'll highlight areas where Keylime, JANE and Veraison can better adopt RATS-recommended standards for data formats, protocols, and interfaces.
* **Actionable Insights:** The mapping should provide clear directions on what aspects of Keylime ,JANE and Veraison could be modified to enhance RATS compliance.

**1. Keylime: Enhanced RATS Mapping**

Here's a breakdown of Keylime's components and a mapping to the RATS architecture, focusing on actionable insights:

* **Attester Role:**
    * **Agent (keylime\_agent):**
        * **RATS Mapping:** Attesting Environment. The agent is the core component that embodies the Attesting Environment. It's responsible for collecting evidence from the platform.
        * **Granular Functions:**
            * TPM quote generation: Aligns with evidence generation using a hardware root of trust.
            * Log collection (UEFI, IMA): Evidence collection from various subsystems.
            * Data Provision: The agent provides collected evidence to the verifier.
        * **Actionable Insights:**
            * **Evidence Representation:** Keylime currently uses various custom and binary formats. Adopting standardized evidence formats like the Conceptual Message Wrapper (CMW) will significantly improve interoperability. This involves structuring the TPM quotes, logs, and other data into a CMW representation.
            * **Evidence conveyance:** While Keylime uses mTLS, defining specific RATS conveyance protocols on top of it will be beneficial.

* **Verifier Role:**
    * **Verifier (keylime\_verifier):**
        * **RATS Mapping:** Evidence Appraisal. The verifier performs the Evidence Appraisal by evaluating the collected evidence.
        * **Granular Functions:**
            * Policy-based verification: This is the core evidence appraisal logic.
            * Runtime attestation: Verifies the runtime state of the system.
            * Attestation result generation: The verifier generates the attestation result based on the policy evaluation.
        * **Actionable Insights:**
            * **Attestation Result Format:** Keylime's current failure-based flags should be replaced with structured attestation results using the EAT format. This involves mapping the outcome of policy evaluations to claims within an EAT structure.
            * **Policy Language:** While Keylime has a policy engine, consider aligning it with emerging standards for attestation policy languages to enhance portability and interoperability.

* **Relying Party Role:**
    * **Verifier (keylime\_verifier):**
        * **RATS Mapping:** Attestation Result Appraisal. In Keylime's architecture, the verifier also takes on the role of making access control decisions based on the attestation results.
        * **Granular Functions:**
            * Enforcement of access control: The verifier enforces access control based on the attestation result.
            * Response mechanisms: The verifier triggers responses based on the verification outcomes.
        * **Actionable Insights:**
            * **Decoupling Policy Enforcement:** Ideally, the policy enforcement logic should be decoupled from the verifier. This would allow external systems or dedicated policy decision points to consume the EAT-formatted attestation results and make access control decisions. This aligns better with the RATS principle of separating verification from policy enforcement.

* **Endorser Role:**
    * **Registrar (keylime\_registrar + keylime\_tenant):**
        * **RATS Mapping:** Endorsement Provisioning. The registrar is responsible for managing trust anchors and metadata, and the tenant is responsible for providing trust anchors, such as the trust anchor for the EK certificate.
        * **Granular Functions:**
            * Trust anchor management: The registrar establishes trust anchors, while the tenant may provide specific trust anchors (e.g., for EK certificates).
            * Metadata management: The registrar manages metadata for attesters.
            * Key binding: The registrar handles AK and EK binding.
        * **Actionable Insights:**
            * **Endorsement Formats:** Ensure that the registrar and tenant can handle and provision endorsements in standardized formats as they emerge. Clarify the division of responsibility for different types of endorsements between the registrar and tenant.

* **Reference Value Provider Role:**
    * **Tenant:**
        * **RATS Mapping:** Reference Value Provisioning. The tenant provides reference values necessary for attestation verification.
        * **Granular Functions:**
            * Reference value supply: The tenant supplies reference values.
            * Policy configuration: The tenant configures attestation policies.
            * Node access management: The tenant manages node access.
        * **Actionable Insights:**
            * **Standardized Policy Representation:** The tenant's configuration of attestation policies should ideally use a standard policy language to improve interoperability.

* **Conveyance Protocols:**
    * **Keylime's REST APIs with mTLS:**
        * **RATS Mapping:** Conveyance. Keylime uses REST APIs with mTLS for secure attestation data exchange.
        * **Actionable Insights:**
            * **Protocol Standardization:** While mTLS provides security, consider defining specific application-level protocols based on RATS reference interaction models. This might involve specifying message formats and exchange patterns for evidence and attestation results.

**2. Jane Attestation Engine: Enhanced RATS Mapping**

the RATS mapping for the Jane Attestation Engine:

* **Attester Role:**
    * **Protocol + Trust Agents (tarzan, ratsd):**
        * **RATS Mapping:** Attesting Environment. The combination of Protocol and Trust Agents in JANE constitute the Attesting Environment.

            * Protocol: Manages attestation sources and handles requests for claims.
            * Trust Agents: Collect attestation measurements from hardware sources (TPM, SGX, etc.) and provide evidence (claims).
        * **Actionable Insights:**
            * **Evidence Normalization:** JANE aims to be technology-agnostic. It is crucial to define a normalization layer within the Trust Agents or Protocol to represent evidence from different sources in a consistent, standardized format (e.g., CMW). This will simplify the Verifier's appraisal process.
            * **Dynamic Attestation:** Enhance the protocol to support dynamic attestation requests, where the verifier can request specific types of evidence or measurements from the attesting environment.

* **Verifier Role:**
    * **Verification:**
        * **RATS Mapping:** Evidence Appraisal. The Verification component performs the Evidence Appraisal by validating claims against predefined rules and reference values.
        * **Granular Functions:**
            * Claim validation: The verification component validates the claims provided by the attesting environment.
            * Rule-based appraisal: The verification component appraises the evidence based on predefined rules.
            * Reference value comparison: The verification component compares the claims against reference values.
        * **Actionable Insights:**
            * **Policy Flexibility:** While JANE uses rules and reference values, consider supporting more expressive and flexible policy languages. This would allow for more complex attestation scenarios and better alignment with policy standards.
            * **Appraisal Context:** Provide a mechanism to include contextual information in the evidence appraisal process. This could include timestamps, location data, or other relevant factors that might influence the verification outcome.
